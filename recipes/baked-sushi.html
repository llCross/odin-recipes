    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked Sushi is a dish that originated in Japan. 
        It is a mixture of different tasty ingredients
    that can be eaten together with nori wrapper (sea weed wrapper). </p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>cups freshly cooked rice</li>
    <li>3 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sesame seeds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>While the sticky and starchy variety is best, Jasmine rice can be substituted in a pinch. Just increase the amount of water used in cooking for a softer texture.</li>
    <li>Wash the rice well until the water runs clear. For umami flavor, cook the rice with a piece of kombu or dried kelp.</li>
    <li>The word sushi actually means “vinegared rice” and not “raw fish”.  The steamed rice is flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt to achieve a delicious balance of sweet, salty, and sourish taste.</li>
    <li>Toss Furikake seasoning with the vinegared rice or sprinkle on top. This seafood flavoring, which is a savory mixture of bonito flakes, sesame seeds, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt, and MSG, is available at most Asian supermarkets or online. For a simple DIY option, quickly toast dried dilis (anchovies) on a hot skillet, grind in a food processor into a coarse powder, and combine with nori strips, sesame seeds, sugar, and salt.</li>
